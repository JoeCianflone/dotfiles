my dotfiles

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. run `start.sh`
4. wait

## Notes
By default this will install PHP 7.0, if you want to use PHP 5.6 or PHP 5.4 you'll need to comment out the PHP70 stuff and uncomment the PHP5X stuff you want. You'll also need to uncomment the corresponding line in the `.bash_profile`
