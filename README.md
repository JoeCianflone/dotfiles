# Dotfiles

I'm a lazy developer, but I'm also fairly opinionated about my system setup. I need a way to install everything I need for a new dev system, without searching. DevStart is my answer. This gets any computer I need up and running as a developer machine in a couple of minutes.

## Install Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. run `start.sh`
4. follow prompts and wait
